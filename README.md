# LibreNMS Example Alerts

LibreNMS is not very plentiful with their example alerts. It took me a significant amount of time to come up with the following alerts so I thought I would create a repository to retain them in the event that I need to rebuild my LibreNMS server in the future. Or, of course, so others could see my examples as well.

```curl_setopt($curl, CURLOPT_URL, ("https://api.telegram.org/bot{$data['token']}/sendMessage?chat_id={$data['chat_id']}&text=$text"));```

And replace it with:

```curl_setopt($curl, CURLOPT_URL, ("https://api.telegram.org/bot{$data['token']}/sendMessage?chat_id={$data['chat_id']}&text=$text&parse_mode=Markdown"));```

## Alert Template

_LibreNMS allows you to customize the alert message that is sent to your transport endpoint. The following is my default message. I did not bother with additional templates._

**Alert Title:** `LibreNMS (%hostname) - NEW ALERT`    
**Recovery Title:** `LibreNMS (%hostname) - CANCELLATION`  
**Alert Body:**  
```
{if %state == 0}Duration: %elapsed{else}Severity: %severity{/if}

{if %name}%name{else}%rule{/if}
---------------------------
Timestamp: %timestamp
Uptime: %uptime_long
```


## TODO

_At this time several of the above rules are either not working or flawed. I have not done any troubleshooting, but simply disabled the rules in favor of resolving the issue at a later time._  

```
 - Host has more than 3 VCPUs: This rule does not work effectively as it spams for physical devices > 3 CPU cores as well. (My hypervisor, workstation, & laptop)  
 - Host has less than 1GB of allocated memory: This rule is ineffective as well as it mis-diagnoses physical devices. (Perhaps they return null for vminfo which triggers a false positive?)  
 - FQDN does not include the domain name: For some reason this rule is also not functional. (Every device that is monitored returns a failure for this check during each interval cycle.)  
 - Host has been down for 5 minutes: Times are not always accurate. Also delivers false positives for reboots occasionally. For example, rebooted my laptop (~45 seconds) and received an alert saying it had been down for 5 minutes.
```


## Alert Example 

_The following is a screenshot of my phone displaying several push notifications using the above rules and templates in conjunction with Pusbullet as my transport endpoint._
